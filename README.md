Data Science Environment Made Easy, built with :heart: and OSS

My goal here is to have a single repo that deploys the tools we use on a regular basis.

I'd love to hear what others are using and possibly add to this repo as well. The way I've structured the tools below is based on how we separate our workflow for project managers so forgive me in advance for any offenses. 

Base tools:
  * Docker
    * Shipyard 
  * Java 7,8
    * Groovy
    * Scala
    * Clojure   
  * Python (Anaconda, PyPy)
  * Ruby (1.9.X, 2.X)
  * Node.js/Io.js
  * Julia
  * R
  * Elasticsearch
  * Logstash
  * Kibana

Distributed Computing:
  * Storm
  * Spark
  * Samza
  * Mesos (::heart:: Mesosphere)
  * Kubernetes
  * Marathon
  * Chronos
  * Kafka
  * Zookeeper
  * Hadoop
  * Flink

Databases:
  * Cassandra
    * Titan
